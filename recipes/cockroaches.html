    <p><b>Would you like to know how to make Coconut Ginger Cockroaches? </b>
        I will tell you. But first, cup my genitals in your hands, they look
        so soft. So soft.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Leave food out overnight for a week until there is a
            healthy cockroach colony.
        </li>
        <li>Befriend cockroaches. Give them each a name.</li>
        <li>Spend years teaching them language and bonding with them.</li>
        <li>Get into a lover's fight and cook them, just chuck
            them in a pot with some ginger bits and coconut milk.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>And now, for the secret.</h2>
    <li>Emotional trauma and years of preparation are what give this 
        recipe such a unique twist.</li>
    <p>Enjoy my grandma's Coconut Ginger Cockroaches.</p>
